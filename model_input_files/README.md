# Model Input Files
This folder contains the processed data files of the input images. The input data was provided in the form of JPG image files. This project processes this data into a different format for use as model input. The data processing sequence generates three differnt file types: LST, IDX, and REC. The LST and IDX files are maintained with the souce code. The REC files (RecordIO file type), along with any raw images, are excluded from this Repo. The size of these files are too large. 

Please see the notes on the **processing_upload2s3.ipynb** notebook for how to access the raw input files, and how to process the data for model input.
